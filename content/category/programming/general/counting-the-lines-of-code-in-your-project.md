summary: How to count the lines of code in your coding project.
title: Counting the Lines of Code in Your Project
---

This may be old news, but I recently discovered [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).

To count the number of code, comment and blank lines run `cloc` while in the project root. Include `--exclude-dir=node_modules_or_whatever to` exclude any directories.

There are many more options to eye-ball.

Have fun :)
