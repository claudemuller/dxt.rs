summary: Understanding and implementing a memory arena for painless memory management in C
title: Simplifying memory management in C with a memory arena
---
A barrier for many people to enjoying the simplicity and low-level benefits of C is the fact that you need to manage memory yourself. This has been no different for me. I find myself coding along only to realise that the data structure I've created in a function has nowhere to go once that frame is popped off the call stack. This realisation is followed by more stressful thoughts such as "who owns this piece of memory?", "where is the best place to free this?", "if this turns out to be a library or reused by someone else, what is the best way to communicate the fact that they are the owners after the function returns?".

Then I came across the idea of a Memory Arena and while it isn't the panacea to all memory woes, it introduces a different want of thinking about memory. What I like about the concept is that it simplifies memory management while keeping you at a low-level and forces you to think deeper about the design of your code and architecture.

The linear allocator or arena allocator works by providing linear chunks of pre-allocated memory to the application code to use. The allocator maintains a pointer to the end/head of the allocated/used memory and when something new needs a place to live, the pointer advances by the size of the data inserted. This operation is fast as it happens in [constant time](/category/programming/general/understanding-big-o/#constant-time-or-o1). Let's see this in diagram form:
