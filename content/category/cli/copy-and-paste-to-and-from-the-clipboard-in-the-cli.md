Firstly make sure that you have the required software installed â€“ `xclip` for Linux or `pbcopy` for MacOS/OSX.

## For Linux

### For Debian-based systems execute the following:

```bash
apt-get install xclip
```

### For Redhat-based systems run:

```bash
yum install xclip
```

### For systems with pacman e.g. Arch and Manjaro:

```bash
pacman -S xclip
```

### Gentoo-based systems:

```bash
emerge xclip
```

If you have any trouble installing `xclip` due to permission levels, prefix the above commands with `sudo` to escalate yourself momentarily to administrator level.

Now for the actual copy and pasting!

To copy text or the output of a command to the clipboard you need to pipe it to `clip -selection clipboard`. The following two examples copy the contents of `readme.txt` and output of `ls` to the clipboard, respectively.

```bash
cat readme.txt | xclip -selection clipboard
```

```bash
$ ls -1 | xclip -selection clipboard
```

And now for pasting from the clipboard. To paste from the clipboard you need to execute:

```bash
$ xclip -o
```

## For MacOS/OSX

`pbcopy` and `pbpaste` should come installed on your system, so no installation there :)

In order to send some output to the clipboard, simply pipe it to `pbcopy`, thusly:

```bash
cat readme.txt | pbcopy
```

And in order to paste the contents from the clipboard run:

```bash
pbpaste
```

The best use of this command would be to redirect the output into a file or assign this command to a keyboard shortcut.

:)
