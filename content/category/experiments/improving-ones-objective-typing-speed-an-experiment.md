summary: An experiment to gauge the amount and speed of progress when attempting to deliberately increase one's typing speed on two different layouts.
title: Improving One's Objective Typing Speed - an Experiment
---
# Introduction

Over the years I have taught myself to touch type using the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") keyboard layout and if memory serves, my maximum recorded speed was around 60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute"). About 4 years ago I wanted to improve my efficiency when typing as I spend around 12+ hours at my keyboard and started exploring alternative keyboard layouts. I decided to give [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak "Colemak") a try. Maybe the time wasn't right, or I wasn't able to spend enough time acquiring the new skill, but it never stuck.

I turned back to [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") somewhat dejected. After some months the bug bit again, and I decided to give the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") layout a go. At the time, about 1 year after the Colemak attempt, I was starting a new job and decided that I would go cold-turkey and hit it at 100% as my on-boarding was quite gentle. This dedicated time seemed to do the trick and as of today, I am touch typing in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") at around 55-60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute").

What spurred the latest desire to improve my typing speed was coming across a "chorded" keyboard and being reminded at how fast one can "type" on a [steno machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) which uses this same "chording" technique. While this is something I definitely want to explore and try, it feels like the learning curve is relatively higher than just improving my conventional typing speed.

Enter the current experiment - see how much I can improve my touch typing speed in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") in 4 weeks of daily, consistent, measurable practice.

# What I'm Expecting/Hypothesis

I'm expecting my typing speed on [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") to improve by at least 20 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute") or about 33%.

# Method

The idea is to practice 5 minute each day per keyboard for 4 weeks using [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) using two different accounts. My baseline speed measurements in [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute") for a 2 minute test on [Monkey Type](https://typing.com) on both keyboards will be recorded the day before commencement and the at end of each week (7 days) in order to track progress.

**Commencement**: 12/05/2024  
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Baseline Measurements**:

# Variables

## Multiple Keyboards = Different Results

Something to mention is that I use 3 different keyboards in my day-to-day, namely:
- a custom-built [Lily58 Pro](https://keyn.co.za/product/lily58pro/) which I use the bulk of the time
  - I have recently fitted this keyboard with [WK Black T1 V2 tactile switches](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C38X9ZGD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
- the built-in keyboard on my personal [System76 Lemur Pro 10](https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/lemp10/README.html)
- I also use the built-in keyboard on my work [Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 4](https://www.lenovo.com/se/sv/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t14-gen-4-(14-inch-intel)/len101t0057)

That said, I will only be specifically practicing and testing on the Lily and the Thinkpad's (T14) built-in keyboard.

## Additional Improvements

I will also try to get into the habit, when I've made a mistake about 3 characters or more into a word, of using `ctrl+backspace` to delete the entire word and retype the whole thing again. I have no way to record the progress of the adoption of this technique nor any way to know how it has affected my typing speed.

## Accuracy of Test Results

With regard to the test results, I will take 1x 2 minute tests, each with a different keyboard and with a 5-minute break in-between.
